# OctoProx

OctoProx is a locally hosted HTTP(S) proxy server that runs on GitHub Actions' runners, utilizing [Playit](https://playit.gg/) to provide a reverse proxy connection. This setup enables public access to your locally hosted proxy server.

## How It Works
OctoProx uses the [simple-proxy](https://github.com/jthomperoo/simple-proxy) server to manage HTTP(S) traffic. The server runs on GitHub Actions' runners, and Playit is used to expose the local server to the internet via a reverse proxy.

### Quick Start
To use the proxy, connect to the following address:

**Proxy Address:** `147.185.221.23:21506`  
**Protocol:** HTTP(S)

### Features
- **Locally Hosted on GitHub Runners**: The proxy is hosted locally on GitHub's infrastructure, but made publicly accessible using Playit.
- **Reverse Proxy with Playit**: Playit creates a secure reverse proxy, allowing external access to the local server.
- **HTTP(S) Support**: Supports both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- **Easy Setup**: No need to configure complex networking, as Playit manages the reverse proxying.

## Setup Guide for Forks

To set up OctoProx on your fork, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
You will need to set up the following GitHub secrets for your fork:

- `FINE_GRAINED_PAT`: A fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token with repository and workflow permissions.
- `PLAYIT_SECRET`: The secret configuration for Playit, used to run the reverse proxy.

To configure these secrets:
1. Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2. Under **Secrets and variables**, select **Actions**.
3. Add the secrets `FINE_GRAINED_PAT` and `PLAYIT_SECRET` with your fine grained personal access token used for this repository and your playit secret, which can be generated by installing and initialising playit on your local machine, creating an account and copy and pasting the content of ~/.config/playit_gg/playit.toml into the secret.

### 3. Workflow Configuration

This repository uses a GitHub Actions runner configured to execute periodically. The workflow file is named `blank.yml`, and it is triggered by the following events:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */5 * * *'  # Runs every 5 hours
